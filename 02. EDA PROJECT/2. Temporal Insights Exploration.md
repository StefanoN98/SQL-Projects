# üìÜ Temporal Exploration

This collection of SQL scripts is designed to extract valuable temporal insights from the dataset, focusing on timeline boundaries, trend and seasonality analysis, customer purchasing lifecycle and regional monthly order patterns.
> üí° This script targets the `Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset` used in the [data warehouse project](https://github.com/StefanoN98/SQL-Project-E-Commerce-Case/blob/613ab33460a9f2584cea7d442ed4edf4a987d2bc/01.%20DATA%20WAREHOUSE%20PROJECT/01.%20DWH%20README.md)

## üîç What This Analysis Accomplishes

### Business Timeline Intelligence
This exploration reveals critical temporal patterns that drive business decisions by systematically analyzing order trends, seasonal fluctuations, customer engagement cycles, and regional market dynamics across the complete dataset timeframe.

### Customer Lifecycle Understanding
Through comprehensive temporal profiling, this module maps customer journey patterns including acquisition periods, purchase frequency, retention characteristics, and churn risk identification, enabling targeted customer relationship strategies.

### Market Trend Identification
The analysis quantifies growth patterns, seasonal variations, and market evolution providing actionable insights for inventory planning, marketing campaign timing, and operational resource allocation.

## üìå Purpose

- ‚úÖ Explore and define the **temporal boundaries** and **key date metrics** within the dataset to understand its coverage and time-related characteristics.
- ‚úÖ Identify and summarize **monthly order trends** and **seasonal patterns** to capture fluctuations and growth in demand over time.
- ‚úÖ Analyze **customer purchasing behavior**, focusing on order frequency and lifecycle duration to assess engagement and retention
- ‚úÖ Examine order **patterns and trends** across different regions to uncover variations .

## Date Profile
This query generates a compact summary of the order dataset, showing key metrics like number of records, unique orders/customers, and date ranges.
The final result is reshaped into a two-column format for easier display and interpretation.
```sql
WITH _profile AS (
    SELECT  CAST(COUNT(*) AS VARCHAR) AS total_records,
            CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS VARCHAR) AS unique_orders,
            CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS VARCHAR) AS unique_customers,
            FORMAT(MIN(order_purchase_timestamp), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS min_purchase_date,
            FORMAT(MAX(order_purchase_timestamp), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS max_purchase_date,
            FORMAT(MIN(order_delivered_customer_date), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS min_delivered_customer_date,
            FORMAT(MAX(order_delivered_customer_date), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS max_delivered_customer_date
    FROM gold.fact_orders
)

SELECT _metric, _value
FROM _profile
UNPIVOT (
    _value FOR _metric IN (
    total_records,unique_orders,unique_customers,
    min_purchase_date, max_purchase_date,
    min_delivered_customer_date, max_delivered_customer_date
    )
) AS unpvt;
```

| Metric                     |  Value       |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Total Records              | 99440        |
| Unique Orders              | 99440        |
| Unique Customers           | 99440        |
| Min Purchase Date          | 2016-09-04   |
| Max Purchase Date          | 2018-10-17   |
| Min Delivered Customer Date| 2016-10-11   |
| Max Delivered Customer Date| 2018-10-17   |

### Remarks:
- Record, orders and customer have the same values because:
	- Each row represent an unique order_id (primary key) 
	- Each order has a unique customer_id (the customer key, not the customer user) <br>
 For more information check [data catalog](https://github.com/StefanoN98/SQL-Projects/blob/e053b28efcea05b94ac57ef2869956cc3d2d4fb7/01.%20DATA%20WAREHOUSE%20PROJECT/Docs/data_catalog.md)
- The data of this ecommerce are related to a period of 2 years between 2016 and 2018
- `max_purchase_date` and `max_delivered_customer_date` coincide, this suggest that the pipeline of the data is interrupted there

## Temporal Distribution
This query analyzes monthly order volumes over time, tracking growth trends, year-to-date totals, and how each month compares to the yearly average. It helps highlight seasonal patterns and month-over-month changes in customer activity.
```sql

### Remarks:
- **2016 Initial Phase**: Data incomplete and not realiable with huge differences in terms of orders month by month. September with only 3 orders can represent a soft launch or internal test, followed by a successful marketing  campaign or platform go-live with 324 orders (+10,700%), while in December a sharp drop to 1 order can indicates extreme volatility or operational issue
- **2017 Strong Growth**: Sustainable growth from January with a peak in November due to **Black Friday** with 7544 orders. In December a drop to 5673 orders (-24.8%) sounds like a typical post-promotional/holydays decline
- **2018 Strong Start, Sudden Fall**: Started with a strong performance until August ,followed by a massive drop in September and October which can represent a data issue (like ETL error or missing transactions)

It helps identify customer behavior patterns over time, such as retention, engagement, and churn risk.

### Analysis:
- **Top Customer Paradox**: Volume ‚â† Value, some highly loyal customers who place frequent orders actually generate lower revenue compared to customers with fewer transactions
  - Customer #1 (17 orders): ‚Ç¨22.77 ‚Üí ‚Ç¨38.66 (LOW VALUE)
  - Customer #4 (7 orders): ‚Ç¨289.07 ‚Üí ‚Ç¨94.20 (HIGH VALUE)
- **Cohort Concentration**: 4 out of 5 top customers originated from Q3-Q4 2017 (September-November). This likely represents the peak growth/acquisition period for the business
- **Customer Lifecycle Diversity**: The top customers show significant variation in engagement patterns:
  - Lifetime Range: 93 ‚Üí 462 days (5x difference)
  - Purchase Frequency: 15 ‚Üí 47 days between orders (3x difference)
  
  This diversity suggests different customer archetypes and purchasing behaviors within the loyal customer base.

## Trend analysis of monthly orders by country
This query analyzes monthly order volume and average delivery time..
It also includes a 12-month rolling average to smooth short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
```sql
