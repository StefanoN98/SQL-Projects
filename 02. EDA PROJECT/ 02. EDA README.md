## üóÑÔ∏è Database Exploration
> üí° This module provides a comprehensive database profiling and documentation framework designed to systematically explore and analyze the structure, metadata, and storage characteristics of a SQL Server Data Warehouse implementation.

üéØ **Objective:** Create a complete database inventory and structural analysis to understand data architecture, quality patterns, and storage optimization opportunities.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Object Inventory
- Complete catalog of all tables and views across database schemas
- Layer distribution analysis showing object count per architectural tier
- Object type classification distinguishing between tables and views

Business Value: Provides foundation for data governance and architectural understanding

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Column Metadata Profiling
- Detailed column specifications including data types, lengths, and constraints
- Nullable field identification for data quality assessment
- Default value documentation for understanding business rules

Business Value: Enables data quality initiatives and system integration planning

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Storage Efficiency Analysis
- Table size measurement in MB with efficiency metrics
- Row count distribution across database objects
- Storage utilization assessment identifying unused space
  
Business Value: Supports capacity planning and performance optimization strategies


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ View Architecture Documentation
- View creation and modification tracking for change management
- Column structure analysis for analytical layer understanding
- SQL definition extraction for logic documentation

Business Value: Maintains analytical layer transparency and supports maintenance workflows
