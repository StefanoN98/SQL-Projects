## 📌 Purpose

- ✅ Explore and define the temporal boundaries and key date metrics within the dataset to understand its coverage and time-related characteristics.
- ✅ Identify and summarize monthly order trends and seasonal patterns to capture fluctuations and growth in demand over time.
- ✅ Analyze customer purchasing behavior, focusing on order frequency and lifecycle duration to assess engagement and retention
- ✅ Examine order patterns and trends across different regions to uncover variations .

## Date Profile
```sql
WITH _profile AS (
    SELECT  CAST(COUNT(*) AS VARCHAR) AS total_records,
            CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS VARCHAR) AS unique_orders,
            CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS VARCHAR) AS unique_customers,
            FORMAT(MIN(order_purchase_timestamp), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS min_purchase_date,
            FORMAT(MAX(order_purchase_timestamp), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS max_purchase_date,
            FORMAT(MIN(order_delivered_customer_date), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS min_delivered_customer_date,
            FORMAT(MAX(order_delivered_customer_date), 'yyyy-MM-dd') AS max_delivered_customer_date
    FROM gold.fact_orders
)

SELECT _metric, _value
FROM _profile
UNPIVOT (
    _value FOR _metric IN (
    total_records,unique_orders,unique_customers,
    min_purchase_date, max_purchase_date,
    min_delivered_customer_date, max_delivered_customer_date
    )
) AS unpvt;
```

| Metric                      | Value        |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Total Records              | 99440       |
| Unique Orders              | 99440       |
| Unique Customers           | 99440       |
| Min Purchase Date          | 2016-09-04   |
| Max Purchase Date          | 2018-10-17   |
| Min Delivered Customer Date| 2016-10-11   |
| Max Delivered Customer Date| 2018-10-17   |

### Remarks:
- Record, orders and customer are the same because:
	- Each row represent an unique order_id (primary key) 
	- Each order has a unique customer_id (the customer key, not the customer user) <br>
 For more information check [data catalog](https://github.com/StefanoN98/SQL-Projects/blob/e053b28efcea05b94ac57ef2869956cc3d2d4fb7/01.%20DATA%20WAREHOUSE%20PROJECT/Docs/data_catalog.md)
- The data of this ecommerce are related to a period of 2 years between 2016 and 2018
- `max_purchase_date` and `max_delivered_customer_date` coincide, this suggest that the pipeline of the data is interrupted there

### Analysis:
- **Top Customer Paradox**: Volume ≠ Value: some highly loyal customers who place frequent orders actually generate lower revenue compared to customers with fewer transactions
  - Customer #1 (17 orders): €22.77 → €38.66 (LOW VALUE)
  - Customer #4 (7 orders): €289.07 → €94.20 (HIGH VALUE)
- **Cohort Concentration**: 4 out of 5 top customers originated from Q3-Q4 2017 (September-November). This likely represents the peak growth/acquisition period for the business
- **Customer Lifecycle Diversity**: The top customers show significant variation in engagement patterns:	
  - Lifetime Range: 93 → 462 days (5x difference)
  - Purchase Frequency: 15 → 47 days between orders (3x difference)
This diversity suggests different customer archetypes and purchasing behaviors within the loyal customer base.
- **Customer Behavior Inconsistency**: The current status classification reveals logical inconsistencies:
  - Customer #5: 93 days lifetime but classified as "Lost"
  - Customer #1: 462 days lifetime but classified as "Active" <br>
Root Cause: Status classification relies solely on recency (days since last order) rather than incorporating behavioral patterns and individual customer purchase cycles. <br>
Recommendation: Implement a more sophisticated segmentation model that considers customer-specific purchasing rhythms and historical behavior patterns.
