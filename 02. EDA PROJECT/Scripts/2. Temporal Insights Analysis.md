## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

- âœ… Explore and define the temporal boundaries and key date metrics within the dataset to understand its coverage and time-related characteristics.
- âœ… Identify and summarize monthly order trends and seasonal patterns to capture fluctuations and growth in demand over time.
- âœ… Analyze customer purchasing behavior, focusing on order frequency and lifecycle duration to assess engagement and retention
- âœ… Examine order patterns and trends across different regions to uncover variations .

## Date Profile
```sql
WITH _profile AS (
    SELECT  CAST(COUNT(*) AS VARCHAR) AS total_records,
            CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS VARCHAR) AS unique_orders,
            CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS VARCHAR) AS unique_customers,
            CAST(CAST(MIN(order_purchase_timestamp) AS DATE) AS VARCHAR) AS min_purchase_date,
            CAST(CAST(MAX(order_purchase_timestamp) AS DATE) AS VARCHAR) AS max_purchase_date,
            CAST(CAST(MIN(order_delivered_customer_date) AS DATE) AS VARCHAR) AS min_delivered_customer_date,
            CAST(CAST(MAX(order_delivered_customer_date) AS DATE) AS VARCHAR) AS max_delivered_customer_date
    FROM gold.fact_orders
)
SELECT _metric, _value
FROM _profile
UNPIVOT (
    _value FOR _metric IN (
    total_records,unique_orders,unique_customers,
    min_purchase_date, max_purchase_date,
    min_delivered_customer_date, max_delivered_customer_date
    )

```

| Metric                      | Value        |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Total Records              | 99,440       |
| Unique Orders              | 99,440       |
| Unique Customers           | 99,440       |
| Min Purchase Date          | 2016-09-04   |
| Max Purchase Date          | 2018-10-17   |
| Min Delivered Customer Date| 2016-10-11   |
| Max Delivered Customer Date| 2018-10-17   |

**Remarks:**
- Record, orders and customer are the same because:
	- Each row represent an unique order_id (primary key)
	- Each order has a unique customer_id (the customer key, not the customer user)
- The data of this ecommerce are related to a period of 2 years between 2016 and 2018
- `max_purchase_date` and `max_delivered_customer_date` coincide, this suggest that the pipeline of the data is interrupted there
