## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

- âœ… Identify and summarize the main statistical properties of key numerical metrics (e.g., payment amounts)
- âœ… Detect outliers using statistical thresholds like IQR and z-score for data quality control
- âœ… Segment observations into pricing brackets (quartiles) for behavioral clustering
- âœ… Compare purchasing power and price dispersion across regions using percentiles and max spend

## Measure Statistical Profile
This dynamic SQL procedure allows the calculation of descriptive statistics for any numerical column, simply by adjusting three input parameters:<br>
- @schema_name â†’ schema of the table <br>
- @table_name â†’ table name <br>
- @column_name â†’ numeric measure to analyze

It generates a compact, categorized output with key metricsâ€”central tendency, dispersion, percentiles, and outlier indicatorsâ€”useful for exploratory data analysis.

```sql
DECLARE @schema_name NVARCHAR(50) = 'gold';
DECLARE @table_name NVARCHAR(50) = 'fact_payments';
DECLARE @column_name NVARCHAR(50) = 'total';
DECLARE @full_table_name NVARCHAR(100) = QUOTENAME(@schema_name) + '.' + QUOTENAME(@table_name);
DECLARE @stat_analysis NVARCHAR(MAX);

SET @stat_analysis = '

In this case the analysis is on the measure **total** which represent how much customer spent for orders. But of course chnaging the parameters it is possible to quickly switch on anotehr measure.

| Category               | Metric     | Value    |

|                        | p99        | 1076     |
| **outlier_detection**  | iqr        | 115      |

### Remarks:
- The mean being higher than the median suggests a positively skewed distribution, meaning a few very high-value orders raise the average.
- The fact that 50% of orders fall between â‚¬62 and â‚¬105 highlights that most orders have relatively low spending, while only 1% exceed â‚¬1,000.
- Orders with a value of â‚¬0 deserve attention, as they may represent errors or special cases (tests, canceled orders).
- Outliers (>â‚¬350â€“400) indicate customers with exceptional spending and should be analyzed as potential VIPs or business transactions.

### Remarks:
- By identifying outliers using the IQR method, it helps isolate exceptional orders that deviate significantly from typical spending patterns. These could indicate data quality issues or high-value customers
- The segmentation into price quartiles (Low, Low-Medium, Medium-High, High) provides a clear breakdown of the order distribution, enabling a deeper understanding of customer spending behavior
- The calculation of the z-score standardizes each orderâ€™s deviation from the mean, offering a quantitative measure to assess normality and identify extreme values beyond simple threshold-based outlier detection.

### Comment:
- Countries like AC, RO, and PB have the highest median order totals, indicating that, on average, customers in these regions tend to spend more per order compared to others. This suggests stronger purchasing power or preference for higher-value products.
- The max values in RJ and  MS are outliers, this means that there are very few people that can spend more than others but this represent less than 1% (could correspond to corporate clients, bulk purchases, or premium customers)
- There are countries like RO where Q1 and Q3 are very close (91â‚¬ vs 241â‚¬) so with less variability (people tend to pay similar), while other countries like RR (65â‚¬ vs 271â‚¬) have a bigger gap eflecting more heterogeneous spending patterns. Such variability may be influenced by economic factors, product mix, or regional market segmentation.
- Countries with higher Q3 values likely have markets characterized by either higher price points or greater consumer welfare, allowing for more frequent or larger purchases. This may be linked to income levels, local economic conditions, or cultural preferences.
