# üìä Advanced Analytics: Country Market Summary (2016‚Äì2018)

## üéØ Purpose

This document contains the SQL query that produces a **market summary by country** from the `gold` layer of the data warehouse.  
The goal is to provide **key metrics** ‚Äî customers, sellers, products, orders, revenue, market profile, and cross-border indicators ‚Äî useful for **business and operational decision-making**.

## üìå Assumptions

- **Reference period**: full timeframe from 2016 to 2018  
- **Excluded orders**: canceled and unavailable orders are not counted (this may cause differences compared to the silver/gold layer analyses in the DWH)  
- **Total customers** = 96095  
- **Total sellers** = 3095  
- **Total products** = 32951, but in the query result there are 33,597 because a product can have multiple sellers and thus appear in multiple regions  
- **Total orders** = 98212 (the query excludes orders with `order_status` in (`'canceled','unavailable'`)  
- **Total revenue** = 15739885,59 (the query excludes orders with `order_status` in (`'canceled','unavailable'`)

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Table Mapping

- `gold.dim_geolocation` ‚Äî geographic/postal information (zip_code ‚Üí country) 
- `gold.dim_customers` ‚Äî customer master data (customer_id, customer_unique_id, customer_zip_code)   
- `gold.dim_sellers` ‚Äî seller master data (seller_id, seller_zip_code)   
- `gold.fact_order_items` ‚Äî order line items (order_id, seller_id, product_id, quantity, price...)   
- `gold.dim_products` ‚Äî product master data (product_id, category...)   
- `gold.fact_orders` ‚Äî order header (order_id, customer_id, order_status, order_purchase_timestamp...)  
- `gold.fact_payments` ‚Äî order payments (order_id, payment_type, total...)

## üí° Why This Query Is Useful for the Business

1. **Market segmentation**: allows classification of markets (Large / Medium / Small) using simple thresholds based on orders and revenue; useful to prioritize commercial and operational investments (market expansion, marketing campaigns, seller onboarding).  
2. **Average order value**: identifies countries with high/low "order value" ‚Äî a fundamental input for pricing, promotions, and discount policies.  
3. **Domestic vs. cross-border analysis**: helps understand the share of local vs. foreign demand; impacts logistics, customs, taxation, and shipping policies.  
4. **Customer spending distribution**: knowing how many customers spend above the average helps define retention and up-sell targets (e.g., loyalty programs, targeted campaigns).  
5. **Outlier identification**: detecting customers with unusually high order counts (max orders by single customer) is useful for account management or to investigate potential fraud / hidden B2B activity.  
6. **Inventory and assortment sizing**: by knowing the number of active products per country and the number of sellers, companies can optimize assortment and manage SKU investment.

## üöÄ How to Leverage This Output for Further Analysis

The output of this query provides a **rich foundation of country-level metrics**, but it can be extended and integrated in several ways to generate deeper insights:

1. **Integration with Marketing Data**  
   - Combine with campaign performance data (click-through rates, conversions, promotions) to identify which market segments respond best to different strategies.  
   - Use `percent_customer_above_average` to target high-value customers with personalized offers or loyalty programs.

2. **Cross-Referencing with Product Analytics**  
   - Link `total_products` and `total_sellers` with product category or inventory data to understand which categories drive revenue in each country.  
   - Identify underperforming SKUs or markets where assortment expansion could increase sales.

3. **Advanced Customer Segmentation**  
   - Leverage `average_spent_by_customer` and `max_orders_by_single_customer` to classify customers into segments (high-value, repeat buyers, occasional buyers) for targeted retention strategies.  
   - Track cross-border activity (`domestic_orders_with_percent` vs `foreign_orders_with_percent`) to adjust international shipping policies or promotional campaigns.

4. **Visualization in BI Tools**  
   - Import the query output into Power BI, Tableau, or Looker to create **interactive dashboards**:  
     - Compare revenue vs order volume per country  
     - Visualize high-value markets geographically  
     - Track trends over time (when combined with timestamped data)  

5. **Scenario Analysis & Forecasting**  
   - Use historical market segmentation and revenue profiles to simulate the impact of marketing initiatives or new seller onboarding.  
   - Combine with external economic or demographic data to predict growth potential in each country.

6. **Cross-Layer Insights**  
   - Integrate this dataset with silver/gold layer analytics (e.g., detailed order items, payment types) to drill down from country-level insights to product- or customer-level actions.  
   - Monitor KPIs over time and feed into automated reporting pipelines for operational decision-making.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details and Interesting SQL Techniques

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: the query is structured into logical, reusable blocks.  
  This makes the logic easier to read, debug, and test (each CTE can be run in isolation).

- **Aggregate ‚Üí Derived ‚Üí Window pattern**: when applying a window function (e.g., `AVG`, `MAX`) on top of already aggregated results (e.g., spending per customer), you need a two-step approach:  
  1. Aggregate at the customer level.  
  2. Apply the window function on the derived set.  
  This avoids errors and database limitations.

- **`COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` usage**: applied frequently to reduce the risk of double-counting caused by joins with transactional tables (`order_items`, `payments`).  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: this operation is expensive on large datasets, so to consider alternative solutions on larger dataset.

- **Divide-by-zero handling**: use `NULLIF(..., 0)` or `CASE WHEN ... > 0 THEN ... ELSE 0 END` to prevent runtime errors or `INF` values.

- **`FORMAT(...)` for readability**: functions like `FORMAT(..., 'N2')` are handy for displaying results, but they can be slow in large-scale aggregations.  
  üëâ Best practice: perform calculations numerically and handle formatting at the visualization layer (BI tool).

- **`LEFT JOIN` vs `INNER JOIN`**: in `customer_seller_product_stats`, `LEFT JOIN`s ensure countries with no customers or sellers are still included in the output.  
  üëâ Use `INNER JOIN` to restrict the dataset to countries with complete information.

- **Robustness**: the use of `ISNULL/NULLIF` and `LEFT JOIN`s in the final select makes the query more tolerant of missing data.
