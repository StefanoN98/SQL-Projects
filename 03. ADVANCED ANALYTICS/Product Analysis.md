## ðŸ“Œ Assumptions


- **Excluded orders**: canceled or unavailable orders are ignored.
- **Revenue per product**: includes total order payments (item price + shipping), that's why `avg_revenue_per_order` is higher than `avg_product_price`.
- **Customer count**: uses customer_unique_id to avoid double-counting repeat customers.
- **Product prices**: may vary over time; averages are computed across all order events.
