# üìä Customer Segmentation & RFM Analysis

## üéØ Purpose

> This document contains a **customer-level segmentation** SQL workflow built on the `gold` layer of the data warehouse. The pipeline computes order totals, per-customer statistics (recency, frequency, monetary), spending quartiles, RFM quartiles and final segments that are actionable for marketing, retention and product teams.

## üìå Assumptions

- **Reference data**: entire dataset available in `gold` (no date filter is applied by default). If you need a specific time window, add `WHERE order_purchase_timestamp BETWEEN @from AND @to` in `order_totals`.
- **Excluded orders**: orders with `order_status` in (`'canceled','unavailable'`) are excluded.
- **Customer identity**: all aggregations use `customer_unique_id` (logical customer identifier) to avoid counting multiple internal `customer_id` values as separate customers.
- **Multiple payments per order**: the query sums `fact_payments.total` per `order_id` to normalize multi-payment orders.
- **Simplified CLV / Avg monthly value**: computed as `total_spent / active_months` (proxy). If you prefer true CLV, integrate churn/retention modeling and margins.

## üóÇÔ∏è Table Mapping

- `gold.fact_orders` ‚Äî order headers (order_id, customer_id, order_status, order_purchase_timestamp)
- `gold.fact_payments` ‚Äî payments per order (order_id, payment_type, total)
- `gold.dim_customers` ‚Äî customer master (customer_id, customer_unique_id)

## üîë Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | Calculation / Notes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **First / Last Order** | `MIN` / `MAX` of `order_purchase_timestamp` per customer | Establishes the customer's lifecycle window
| **Recency (days)** | Days between customer's last_order and dataset last order | Proxy for engagement; used in recency quartile
| **Total Orders** | `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` | Frequency measure used for RFM
| **Active Months** | Count distinct `yyyyMM` months with orders | Engagement depth: frequent monthly buyers vs burst buyers
| **Avg Days Between Orders** | `(last - first) / (orders - 1)` (special-case handling for single-day orders) | Measures pacing of repeat purchases
| **Total Spent** | Sum of order totals per customer | Monetary metric for segmentation
| **Avg Order Value** | `AVG(order_total)` | Typical basket size
| **Order Value StdDev** | `STDEV(order_total)` | Dispersion of order values
| **Avg Monthly Value** | `total_spent / active_months` (proxy CLV) | Simple proxy for recurring monthly revenue from the customer
| **Spending Quartile** | `NTILE(4)` on `total_spent` | Quick stratification into 4 equal groups
| **RFM quartiles** | `NTILE(4)` on recency, frequency, monetary | Classic segmentation building block
| **Customer segments** | rules combining quartiles ‚Üí human-readable labels | Actionable groups for marketing/retention

## üí° Why This Is Useful for the Business

- **Prioritize retention efforts**: identify "Top Champions" and "Loyal High Value" customers for VIP programs.  
- **Targeted reactivation**: focus "At Risk" customers with win-back campaigns.  
- **Promotions & offers**: tune promotions by segment (e.g., cross-sell to "Mid Value Regulars").  
- **Product & category insights**: correlate segments with SKU preferences to optimize assortment and merchandising.  
- **Operational planning**: forecast recurring revenue from avg_monthly_value and model impact of retention improvements.

---

## üöÄ How the End User Can Leverage The Output

1. **Import into BI dashboards** (Power BI / Tableau / Looker): create interactive filters by segment, heatmaps of recency vs frequency, and funnel visualizations.  
2. **Feed Marketing Automation**: export Top Champions and Loyal High Value customer lists to CRM / email platforms for personalized flows.  
3. **Churn detection & early warning**: monitor movement between RFM segments over time; customers sliding toward "At Risk" can be automatically flagged.  
4. **Cohort & retention analysis**: combine with first_order date to measure retention curves by cohort and segment.  
5. **A/B test offers**: run promotion experiments per segment and measure lift on average order value and repeat purchase rate.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details & SQL Techniques

- **CTEs**: modular steps (normalization ‚Üí customer aggregates ‚Üí quartiles ‚Üí segmentation) improve readability and testing.  
- **NTILE for quartiles**: partitions customers into approximately equal-sized buckets; sensitive to ties and distribution skew.  
- **Window functions**: used for quartiles and ranking without subqueries.  
- **Cross join for global scalar**: `CROSS JOIN max_date` attaches the dataset-level last_date to every customer row for recency calc.  
- **Null-safe division**: `NULLIF(...,0)` used to avoid division-by-zero when computing avg_monthly_value.  
- **Edge-case handling**: `avg_days_between_orders` checks `total_orders = 1` and same-day repeat orders.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance & Productionization Notes

- `NTILE(4)` and `STDEV` on very large customer bases can be expensive. Consider:
  - Pre-aggregating `order_totals` in a materialized view / nightly batch.  
  - Using approximate quantiles (if supported) for very large datasets.  
- Index suggestions: `fact_orders(order_id, customer_id, order_purchase_timestamp)`, `fact_payments(order_id)`, `dim_customers(customer_id, customer_unique_id)`.  
- If `fact_payments` contains multiple rows per order (split payments), the `SUM(fp.total)` per `order_id` step avoids double-counting.  
- If you plan incremental runs, persist intermediate `order_totals` and `customer_stats` into a `mart` table with a timestamp partition.
