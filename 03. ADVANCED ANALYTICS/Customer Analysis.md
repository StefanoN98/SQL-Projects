# üìä Customer Segmentation & RFM Analysis

## üéØ Purpose

> This document contains a **customer-level segmentation** built on the `gold` layer of the data warehouse. The pipeline computes order totals, per-customer statistics (recency, frequency, monetary), spending quartiles, RFM quartiles and final segments that are actionable for marketing, retention and product teams.

## üìå Assumptions
- **Excluded orders**: orders with `order_status` in (`'canceled','unavailable'`) are excluded.
- **Customer identity**: all aggregations use `customer_unique_id` (logical customer identifier) to avoid counting multiple internal `customer_id` values as separate customers.
- **Multiple payments per order**: the query sums `fact_payments.total` per `order_id` to normalize multi-payment orders.
- **Simplified CLV / Avg monthly value**: computed as `total_spent / active_months` (proxy). 
---

## üóÇÔ∏è Table Mapping

- `gold.fact_orders` ‚Äî order headers (order_id, customer_id, order_status, order_purchase_timestamp)
- `gold.fact_payments` ‚Äî payments per order (order_id, payment_type, total)
- `gold.dim_customers` ‚Äî customer master (customer_id, customer_unique_id)

## üîë Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | Calculation / Notes | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **First / Last Order** | `MIN` / `MAX` of `order_purchase_timestamp` per customer | Establishes the customer's lifecycle window
| **Recency (days)** | Days between customer's last_order and dataset last order | Proxy for engagement; used in recency quartile
| **Total Orders** | `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` | Frequency measure used for RFM
| **Active Months** | Count distinct `yyyyMM` months with orders | Engagement depth: frequent monthly buyers vs burst buyers
| **Avg Days Between Orders** | `(last - first) / (orders - 1)` (special-case handling for single-day orders) | Measures pacing of repeat purchases.<br> If avg_days_between_orders shows "More Orders the same day," it means that someone bought multiple items on the same day,<br>and these are often low-value items, which is clearly reflected in total_spent that actually identifies it in the<br>average segment usually. Additionally, the standard deviation is very low, as if they are buying very similar items to each other and, in any case,<br>not expensive (e.g., buying markers, pencils of various colors). |
| **Total Spent** | Sum of order totals per customer | Monetary metric for segmentation
| **Avg Order Value** | `AVG(order_total)` | Typical basket size
| **Order Value StdDev** | `STDEV(order_total)` | Dispersion of order values
| **Avg Monthly Value** | `total_spent / active_months` (proxy CLV) | Simple proxy for recurring monthly revenue from the customer
| **Spending Quartile** | **High Value** ü†í spending_quartile = 4<br>**Upper Mid Value** ü†í spending_quartile = 3<br>**Lower Mid Value** ü†í spending_quartile = 2<br>**Low Value** ü†í spending_quartile = 1 | Quick stratification into 4 equal groups
| **RFM quartiles** | monetary_quartile = `mq` <br> frequency_quartile = `fq` <br> recency_quartile= `rq` <br>**Top Champions** ü†í `mq` = 4 & `fq` = 4 & `rq` = 1<br> **Loyal High Value** ü†í `mq` ‚â• 3 & `fq` ‚â• 3 & `rq` ‚â§ 2<br> **Mid Value Regular** ü†í `mq` ‚â• 2 & `fq` ‚â• 2 <br> **At Risk** ü†í `rq` ‚â• 3 <br>**Low Value** ü†í all other cases (fallback category) | RFM segmentation
| **Customer segments** | rules combining quartiles ‚Üí human-readable labels | Actionable groups for marketing/retention

## üí° Why This Is Useful for the Business

1. **Customer value hierarchy** ‚Üí Marketing can instantly identify top-tier customers ("Top Champions" / "Loyal High Value") vs. low-value or at-risk customers, enabling differentiated strategies.

2. **Retention vs. acquisition trade-off** ‚Üí Finance and growth teams can quantify the revenue risk of churn vs. the cost of new customer acquisition.

3. **Win-back opportunities** ‚Üí Segments like `At Risk` highlight dormant customers that can be re-engaged with personalized offers.

4. **Personalized product strategy** ‚Üí By joining these segments with product/SKU data, merchandising can learn which categories retain high-value customers and optimize assortments.

5. **Revenue forecasting** ‚Üí `avg_monthly_value` offers a lightweight but effective proxy for expected recurring revenue, useful in budgeting and scenario planning.

## üöÄ How the End User Can Leverage The Output


The query output provides a customer-level view that blends **monetary
value, purchase frequency, and recency signals**. This enables a wide
range of analytical extensions and business applications:

1. **Customer Journey Tracking**

   -   Use `first_order` and `last_order` to reconstruct individual
    timelines and detect **time-to-second-purchase** or long inactive
    periods.
   -   `avg_days_between_orders` highlights buying rhythm, helping
    distinguish **habitual repeat buyers** from **sporadic purchasers**.

2. **Loyalty and Churn Diagnostics**

   -   `recency_days` and `active_months` together provide a clear view of
    customer engagement depth.
   -   Customers drifting into "At Risk" segments can be proactively
    flagged for intervention before churn becomes permanent.

3. **Revenue Stability Analysis**

   -   Combine `avg_order_value` with `order_value_stddev` to identify
    **predictable revenue contributors** vs.¬†**volatile spenders**.
   -   `avg_monthly_value` works as a simplified CLV proxy to monitor the
    **stability of recurring revenue streams**.

4. **Segment Transition Monitoring**

   -   Compare `customer_segment_base` and `customer_segment_RFM` over time
    to understand **upgrades, downgrades, and retention pathways**.
   -   Transitions (e.g., "Loyal High Value" ‚Üí "At Risk") can be tracked as
    an **early-warning KPI** for account managers.

5. **Portfolio and Cohort Evaluation**

   -   Aggregate by `first_order` cohorts to see how different acquisition
    waves perform in terms of retention and revenue contribution.
   -   Assess whether recent cohorts produce a higher share of "Top
    Champions" or stagnate in "Low Value" segments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details & SQL Techniques

- **CTEs**: modular steps (normalization ‚Üí customer aggregates ‚Üí quartiles ‚Üí segmentation) improve readability and testing.  
- **NTILE for quartiles**: partitions customers into approximately equal-sized buckets; sensitive to ties and distribution skew.  
- **Window functions**: used for quartiles and ranking without subqueries.  
- **Cross join for global scalar**: `CROSS JOIN max_date` attaches the dataset-level last_date to every customer row for recency calculation.  
- **Null-safe division**: `NULLIF(...,0)` used to avoid division-by-zero when computing avg_monthly_value.  
- **Edge-case handling**: `avg_days_between_orders` checks `total_orders = 1` and same-day repeat orders.
