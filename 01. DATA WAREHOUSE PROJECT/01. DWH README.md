# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📝 Overview

This project focuses on building a **Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL Server**, implementing robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes to handle structured data from CSV sources. The architecture follows the **Medallion approach** (**Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**) to ensure data is efficiently ingested, cleaned, transformed, and optimized for analytical consumption.

## 🏗 Data Architecture

The project adheres to the **Medallion Architecture**, which consists of three layers:

Only one table has been merged into an unique one. For the other tables in the Gold layer, some columns have been added or removed compared to the Bronze and Silver layers.

## 🟤 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- 📂 Stores **raw data** as received from source systems (**CRM, ERP**) in **CSV format**.
- ❌ No transformation is applied.
- ⚙ Data is loaded using **batch processing** with **full load** and **truncate & insert strategies** (stored procedures).
- 📌 **Object Type**: Tables

### Actions & Structure
In this layer there are 3 queries:
1.  **DDL Query** which defines and creates all required tables using a *Drop & Create* approach to ensure a clean structure on each run.
    
2.  **Bulk Insert Query** where the data are load with a *Truncate & Inser*t method. The script, for some tables, leverages WIDECHAR and UNICODE encoding to correctly handle foreign and special characters.
   
3.  **Stored Procedure** which automates the data loading process in a single execution. It includes basic error handling and execution time logging for each table to facilitate monitoring and debugging.

## ⚪ 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned, Standardized Data)
- 🧹 Cleanses and **standardizes raw data** for **consistency and quality**.
- 🔍 Performs **data cleansing, normalization, derived columns, and enrichment**.
- 📌 **Object Type**: Tables


### Actions & Structure
#### Within the Silver Layer, extensive data transformations and validations were performed to ensure data quality, consistency, and compliance with business rules. Key operations include:

- Detection and removal of duplicates and `NULL` values  
- Identification and handling of empty strings and unwanted characters  
- Validation of logical consistency across datasets  
- Derivation of new columns based on business logic  
- Enforcement of business rules and data constraints  
- Referential integrity verification  
- Management and correction of special and non-standard characters  
- Application of data standardization processes
- Create a customized function using T-SQL

#### To implement these transformations, a variety of SQL functions and features were leveraged, including:

- **String Functions:** `TRIM`, `LEN`, `LEFT`, `LIKE`, `SUBSTRING`, `REPLACE`  
- **Date Functions:** `ISDATE`, `DATEADD`  
- **Null Handling Functions:** `IS NULL`, `NULLIF`, `COALESCE`  
- **Data Type Conversion:** `CAST`, `TRY_CONVERT`  
- **Aggregate Functions:** `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`  
- Control flow with **CASE WHEN** expressions  
- Use of **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Subqueries** for modular and readable queries  
- **Window functions** such as `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK` for advanced ranking and partitioning  
- Data modification with `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements  
- Advanced transformations using `PIVOT`, `TRANSLATE`, and `STRING_AGG`

#### In this layer for each table a dedicated .md file has been created with the following structure:
1. **Initial DDL**  where the table is created and the data inserted
2. **Check Summary** a table listing all cleaning actions to be implemented, divided by category.
3. **Cleaning Queries** the actual queries to clean data, grouped by column or dedicated to a specific issue
4. **Final DDL** in case of changes of the table structure (new columns, change datatype, etc) a new DLL will be written

## 🟡 3. Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
- 💡 Provides **transformed data** optimized for **analytics and reporting**.
- 🔄 Applies **data integration, aggregation, and business logic**.
- 📌 **Object Type**: Views 
- 🌟 Implements **Star Schema model**.
